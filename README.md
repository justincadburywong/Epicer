# Epicer

An app to store and view all of my recipes in one place!  I can finally get rid of my binder!

## User stories

A user can log in, log out, sign up, etc

A user can see all of the recipes on the website

A user can add, edit and delete their own recipes

## Stretch goals

A recipe can be printed pretty

A user can scrape a recipe off an input URL

A user can change the serving size and the recipe will self-adjust



## Give it a try

Clone the repo

Run `bundle install`, `bundle exec rake db:create`, `bundle exec rake db:migrate`, and finally `bundle exec rails s`
